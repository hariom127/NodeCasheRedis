# Node.js caching mechanisms with mongoDB

Introduction:
This project aims to provide advanced caching mechanisms to improve the performance of web applications. The caching mechanisms used in this project are Node.js, express.js, react.js, mongoDB, redis, and Google OAuth.

Technologies used:
- Node.js: A popular server-side JavaScript runtime environment used for building scalable network applications.
- Express.js: A lightweight and flexible web application framework for Node.js.
- React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- MongoDB: A NoSQL document-oriented database used for storing and retrieving data.
- Redis: An in-memory data structure store used as a database, cache, and message broker.
- Google OAuth: A secure and easy-to-use authentication mechanism provided by Google.

Features:
- Caching: The project provides advanced caching mechanisms to improve the performance of web applications.
- Redis: Redis is used as a cache to store frequently accessed data, which reduces the number of requests to the database.
- MongoDB: MongoDB is used as a database to store persistent data.
- Google OAuth: Google OAuth is used for authentication, which provides a secure and easy-to-use authentication mechanism for users.
- React.js: React.js is used for building the user interface, which provides a fast and responsive user experience.

Installation:
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Install the required dependencies using npm install command.
- Create a .env file and add the required environment variables.
- Start the server using npm start command.

Conclusion:
The project provides advanced caching mechanisms using Node.js, express.js, react.js, mongoDB, redis, and Google OAuth. It improves the performance of web applications by reducing the number of requests to the database and providing a fast and responsive user experience.
